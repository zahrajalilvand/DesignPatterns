It's a subsystem of structural pattern and it's been used for complex or legacy systems which refactoring is hard enough.
Declaring facade design pattern to access to many other classes which popular methods of them can call in class which facade design has been run.

Advantages
	1.Run easily
	2.No limmited in declairing Facad for subsystems
	3.Intermediary facade doesn't related to intermediary subsystems
	4.Can use singelton instead of facade and it's better to declare facad as static for not to make an object and make overload
	5.Implemente facad as abstract class or any other type
	6.make facade in more layer for every subsystems
	7.Make easy to use more classes

Why shoule use Facade?
	1.When you want that clients use obejects less
	2.When you want to support clients from high level code changing
	3.When you have many other complecated subsystems and you want do it simple for client
	4.when you want to implement layerd in project designning
