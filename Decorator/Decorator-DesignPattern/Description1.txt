points
    #1 The Component Class doesn't have to be abstract class, it could be Interface
    #2 It doesn't deffrent between ConcreteComponent and ConcreteDecorator, because both of them have to inherit from Component
    #3 ConceretDecorator doesn't know which object is going to decorate and Concrete doesn't know that what's going on
    #4 If you have limited peroperties you can change Decorator to class(not abstract class) but if you have many properties you must make abstract class and impelement it
    #5 Sometimes we don't need all method of a component so we must impelement methods but just refer to base not to use method to do sth.Like decorator2 in sample
